QGIS instructions:
the trick is to write a path name to the beachball.svg file as an attribute in the cmt shapefile, QGIS can then set the symbology from the svg file.
layer properties > single symbol > symbol layer type = SVG marker
the file path under SVG groups - far right drop down menu, select > field type (string) > foal mech (string)
hit apply/ok
also scale the size of the beachballs by the Mw etc. the same way

ArcGIS and Google earth simple load the kml file (make sure it is in the same folder as the .png's it is linking to
ArcGIS is clunky when displaying lots of images!
